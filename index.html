    <p>Half a century into the space age, we have expanded the limits of exploration, but we have carried our habit of
      spreading filth even into this domain as well. Space debris, which stands today as unnoticed as a black cat in a
      coal mine is culminating to hault the progress of space technologies.
    </p>
    <blockquote>We are putting so much debris in space that we may close ourselves from off from space due 
      to the dangers of the space travel, posed by our own garbage heap!
                                                                        -Neil DeGras Tyson

    In the first 67 space shuttle launches, 177 impacts were found on the windows alone, that were predicted to be caused
    objects of size smaller than even a mm!
